UBC EECE 281 - Project 1 2014

This project automates a soldering reflow iron by controlling it with a Altera DE2 board running a 8051 emulator (in a FPGA).

A MPC3004 ADC is used along with a BJT, a SSC connected to the oven and a LM335 (to measure the reference temp) along with a thermocouple (to measure the oven temp)

We modeled the code after a Mealy state machine for code clarity and best practices.
